# Library-Management-System
My system is so easy to use because it can run on any machine without any extra setup, i used an embedded server and H2 Db, To simplify the trials.
So make sure that each time you run the app and use the APIs you have to populate your data again because H2 uses in-memory storage, i could have used any DB but to avoid local DB I decided to use H2.
